# Learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). 
RAG is a cutting-edge technique that enhances LLM capabilities by integrating external knowledge retrieval with natural language generation.

## Study Plan

### Phase 1: Foundations of RAG and LLMs (2-3 Weeks)
#### Topics to Learn:
1. Understanding LLMs:
   - Transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, tokenization, and embeddings.
   - Introduction to Hugging Face library.

2. Retrieval Systems Basics:
   - Vector similarity search and tools like FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate.
   - Elasticsearch and inverted indices.

3. RAG Concepts:
   - What is RAG and its applications?
   - Difference between RAG and traditional LLM inference.
   - Tools: LangChain, Haystack.

#### Resources:
- Courses: "Transformers for NLP" on Coursera by Hugging Face.
- Documentation: Hugging Face, LangChain, Haystack.
- Practice: Deploy basic LLMs using Hugging Face models.

### Phase 2: Hands-On with Retrieval Systems (3-4 Weeks)
#### Topics to Learn:
1. Implementing Vector Stores:
   - Build a vector store using FAISS or Pinecone.
   - Optimize retrieval with embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, SentenceTransformers).

2. Data Preparation:
   - Preprocess data for embeddings.
   - Create a knowledge base (e.g., PDFs, text files).

3. Integrating Retrieval with LLMs:
   - Combine a retrieval layer with LLM inference.
   - Tools: LangChain pipelines.

#### Projects:
- Build a QA system using FAISS + Hugging Face models.
- Deploy a simple RAG pipeline on a dataset of your choice.

### Phase 3: Advanced RAG and Deployment (4-5 Weeks)
#### Topics to Learn:
1. Scaling and Optimization:
   - Optimize retrieval for latency and accuracy.
   - Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse methods).

2. Advanced Architectures:
   - Fine-tune LLMs for specific domains.
   - Prompt engineering and advanced chaining.

3. Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy RAG systems on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP).
   - Use Docker/Kubernetes for scalable applications.

#### Projects:
- Deploy an end-to-end RAG application (e.g., customer support chatbot).
- Optimize the application for a specific domain (e.g., HRIS knowledge base).

### Continuous Learning (Ongoing)
1. Participate in open-source contributions (LangChain, Haystack, etc.).
2. Stay updated with research papers, webinars, and conferences.
3. Explore advanced use cases (e.g., integrating RAG with analytics tools).
